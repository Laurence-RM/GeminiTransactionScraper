# GeminiTransactionScraper
A userscript to scrape transactions from Gemini's Credit Card Transaction History.

Created before they added their own csv download feature (year by year only).

This script will scrape your entire transaction history and create a CSV formatted to work with Monarch.

### Updated 4/1/24
 - Added support for new transaction page
 - Can now select the starting date to pull transactions from using date picker or input box
